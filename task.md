# The TasK

The task is to parse a log file containing HTTP requests and to report on its contents. For a given log file we want to know:
* The number of unique IP addresses 
* The top 3 most visited URLs
* The top 3 most active IP addresses

I have interpreted the second point to read paths, excluding domain name.

Chosen Tech:
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Jest 


Please run `npm test` to run the test scripts.
